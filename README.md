# Immutable Tic Tac Toe

This is a tiny exercise I have used to play with immutability in Ruby.

The idea behind the exercise was being able to face the challenges that
creating a new object instead of mutating state imposes on your design.
Despite being a very, very simple problem you have to take decisions on
how to represent the board and taken positions which may affect greatly
the simplicity of the solution.

I also created a very simple and *hacky* http frontend that can be used
to play the game.
